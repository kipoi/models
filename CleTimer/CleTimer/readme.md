# CleTimer 

This is a linear model that predicts donor/acceptor cleavage time based on the extended intronic sequence. 
See model readme (model.yaml) and dataloader readme (dataloader.yaml) for more information on the functions.
NB! Current version of the model doesn't work on introns shorter than 80bp
