    This CNN is based on the DeepSEA model from Zhou and Troyanskaya (2015).
    It categorically predicts 918 cell type-specific epigenetic features
    from DNA sequence. The model is trained on publicly available ENCODE
    and Roadmap Epigenomics data and on DNA sequences of size 1000bp. The
    input of the tensor has to be (N, 1000, 4) for N samples, 1000bp window
    size and 4 nucleotides. Per sample, 918 probabilities of showing a
    specific epigentic feature will be predicted.
