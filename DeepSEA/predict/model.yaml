    This CNN is based on the DeepSEA model from Zhou and Troyanskaya (2015).
    The model has been converted to a pytorch model on a modified version of
    https://github.com/clcarwin/convert_torch_to_pytorch
    Use this model only for predictions of sequences, not for variant effect
    prediction. The model automatically generates reverse-complement and
    averages over forward and reverse-complement to results from the website.
    To predict variant effects use the DeepSEA/variantEffects model.
    It categorically predicts 919 cell type-specific epigenetic features
    from DNA sequence. The model is trained on publicly available ENCODE
    and Roadmap Epigenomics data and on DNA sequences of size 1000bp. The
    input of the tensor has to be (N, 4, 1, 1000) for N samples, 1000bp window
    size and 4 nucleotides. Per sample, 919 probabilities of a
    specific epigentic feature will be predicted.

  trained_on: "Chromosome 8 and 9 were excluded from training, and the rest of the autosomes were used for training and validation. 4,000 samples on chromosome 7 spanning the genomic coordinates 30,508,751-35,296,850 were used as the validation set. Data were ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics chromatin profiles https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3547#methods"
