    This model predicts the log2 fold change in mean ribosome load from introducing variants
    into the 5' UTR of a sequence. Additionally, the model will provide log2 fold changes
    due to variants assuming the frame of the sequence has been shifted. High log fold
    changes after such shifts can provide an indication that a new in-frame start has been
    created within the 5' UTR, lengthening the canonical protein.
    The Model adapted from Sample et al: 
    Human 5 prime UTR design and variant effect prediction from a massively parallel
    translation assay (https://doi.org/10.1101/310375).
    Several modifications have been added to allow arbitrary length inputs, 
    instead of fixed size.
  trained_on: >
    Data from MPRA experiment using eGFP library on HEK293T cells. Trained on eGFP library (260k
    sequences). 
    20,000 sequences were withheld for testing, and additional validations on endogenous data were performed.
