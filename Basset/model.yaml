    This is the Basset model published by David Kelley converted to pytorch
    by Roman Kreuzhuber.
    It categorically predicts probabilities of accesible genomic regions in 
    164 cell types. Data was generated using DNAse-seq. The sequence length
    the model uses as input is 600bp.
    The input of the tensor has to be (N, 4, 600, 1) for N samples, 600bp window
    size and 4 nucleotides. Per sample, 164 probabilities of accessible chromatin
    will be predicted.
