    transcription factor binding from nucleotide-resolution sequential data

    Abststract:
    
    Due to the large numbers of transcription factors (TFs) and cell
    types, querying binding profiles of all TF/cell type pairs is not
    experimentally feasible, owing to constraints in time and
    resources. To address this issue, we developed a
    convolutional-recurrent neural network model, called FactorNet, to
    computationally impute the missing binding data. FactorNet trains
    on binding data from reference cell types to make accurate
    predictions on testing cell types by leveraging a variety of
    features, including genomic sequences, genome annotations, gene
    expression, and single-nucleotide resolution sequential signals,
    such as DNase I cleavage. To the best of our knowledge, this is
    the first deep learning method to study the rules governing TF
    binding at such a fine resolution. With FactorNet, a researcher
    can perform a single sequencing assay, such as DNase-seq, on a
    cell type and computationally impute dozens of TF binding
    profiles. This is an integral step for reconstructing the complex
    networks underlying gene regulation. While neural networks can be
    computationally expensive to train, we introduce several novel
    strategies to significantly reduce the overhead. By visualizing
    the neural network models, we can interpret how the model predicts
    binding which in turn reveals additional insights into regulatory
    grammar. We also investigate the variables that affect cross-cell
    type predictive performance to explain why the model performs
    better on some TF/cell types than others, and offer insights to
    improve upon this field. Our method ranked among the top four
    teams in the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding
    Site Prediction Challenge.
