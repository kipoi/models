  doc: 'FactorNet: a deep learning framework for predicting cell type specific transcription
    factor binding from nucleotide-resolution sequential data

    Github link - https://github.com/uci-cbcl/FactorNet

    Abststract:

    Due to the large numbers of transcription factors (TFs) and cell types, querying
    binding profiles of all TF/cell type pairs is not experimentally feasible, owing
    to constraints in time and resources. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional-recurrent
    neural network model, called FactorNet, to computationally impute the missing
    binding data. FactorNet trains on binding data from reference cell types to make
    accurate predictions on testing cell types by leveraging a variety of features,
    including genomic sequences, genome annotations, gene expression, and single-nucleotide
    resolution sequential signals, such as DNase I cleavage. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first deep learning method to study the rules governing TF binding
    at such a fine resolution. With FactorNet, a researcher can perform a single sequencing
    assay, such as DNase-seq, on a cell type and computationally impute dozens of
    TF binding profiles. This is an integral step for reconstructing the complex networks
    underlying gene regulation. While neural networks can be computationally expensive
    to train, we introduce several novel strategies to significantly reduce the overhead.
    By visualizing the neural network models, we can interpret how the model predicts
    binding which in turn reveals additional insights into regulatory grammar. We
    also investigate the variables that affect cross-cell type predictive performance
    to explain why the model performs better on some TF/cell types than others, and
    offer insights to improve upon this field. Our method ranked among the top four
    teams in the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction
    Challenge.
