    Abstract:
    DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the establishment of tissue-specific
    gene expression and the regulation of key biological processes. However, our
    present inability to predict the effect of genome sequence variation on DNA
    methylation precludes a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of
    non-coding variation. We introduce CpGenie, a sequence-based framework that
    learns a regulatory code of DNA methylation using a deep convolutional neural
    network and uses this network to predict the impact of sequence variation on
    proximal CpG site DNA methylation. CpGenie produces allele-specific DNA methylation
    prediction with single-nucleotide sensitivity that enables accurate prediction
    of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL). We demonstrate that CpGenie
    prioritizes validated GWAS SNPs, and contributes to the prediction of
    functional non-coding variants, including expression quantitative trait
    loci (eQTL) and disease-associated mutations. CpGenie is publicly available to
    assist in identifying and interpreting regulatory non-coding variants.
