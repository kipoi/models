    Kipoi ensemble model without conservation. The used models are - MaxEntScan/3prime,
    MaxEntScan/5primet, labranchor, HAL
  tags:
  - RNA splicing
  trained_on: "ClinVar (release 2018-04-29) variants in the range [-40nt, 10nt] around the splicing acceptor or variants in the range [-10, 10] nt around the splice donor of a protein coding gene. Only variants labelled 'Pathogenic' or 'Benign' were used. Data from all chromosomes was used for training."
