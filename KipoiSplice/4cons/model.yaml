    This model is similar to KipoiSplice/4, but is additionally base on
    4 conservational features  - phyloP46way_placental, phyloP46way_primate, CADD_raw and CADD_phred.

        Pathogenicity score. 0th index represents the probability of
        being benign and 1st index represents the probability for being pathogenic.
