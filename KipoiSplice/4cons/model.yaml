    This model is similar to KipoiSplice/4, but is additionally base on 4 conservational
    features  - phyloP46way_placental, phyloP46way_primate, CADD_raw and CADD_phred.
  tags:
  - RNA splicing
  trained_on: "ClinVar (release 2018-04-29) variants in the range [-40nt, 10nt] around the splicing acceptor or variants in the range [-10, 10] nt around the splice donor of a protein coding gene. Only variants labelled 'Pathogenic' or 'Benign' were used. Data from all chromosomes was used for training."
