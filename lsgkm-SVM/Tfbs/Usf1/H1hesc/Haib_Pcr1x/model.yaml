  doc: 'lsgkm-SVM model trained on the ENCODE datasets - no sample number limitation
    as opposed to gkm-SVM publication. AUC on chr8 and chr9 of 0.989608 on ENCODE
    track: wgEncodeHaibTfbsH1hescUsf1Pcr1xAlnRep0. Track had 21929 non-''N''-containing
    peaks genomewide.'
  trained_on: 'ENCODE track: wgEncodeHaibTfbsH1hescUsf1Pcr1xAlnRep0'
  training_procedure: Datasets downloaded from http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/peaks/jan2011/spp/optimal/hub/.
    All files were then processed using genNullSeqs(...,nMaxTrials=20,xfold=1,genomeVersion="hg19")
    from the gkmSVM package version 0.79.0. For training all chroomosomes except chr8
    and chr9 were used!
