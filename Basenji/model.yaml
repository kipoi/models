    Abstract
    Models for predicting phenotypic outcomes from genotypes have important applications to
    understanding genomic function and improving human health. Here, we develop a machine learning
    system to predict cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptional profiles in large
    mammalian genomes from DNA sequence alone. Using convolutional neural networks, this system
    identifies promoters and distal regulatory elements and synthesizes their content to make effective
    gene expression predictions. We show that model predictions for the influence of genomic variants
    on gene expression align well to causal variants underlying eQTLs in human populations and can
    be useful for generating mechanistic hypotheses to enable fine mapping of disease loci.
