      LaBranchoR (LSTM Branchpoint Retriever) uses a LSTM network built with keras to predict
      the position of RNA splicing branchpoints relative to a three prime splice site.
      Precisely evaluating LaBranchoR was challenging due to pervasive noise in the experimental data,
      but as we show in our paper, we estimate that LaBranchoR correcty predicts a branchpoint for over
      90% of 3\'ss. Github link https://github.com/jpaggi/labranchor.
