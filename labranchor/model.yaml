    LaBranchoR (LSTM Branchpoint Retriever) uses a LSTM network built with keras
    to predict the position of RNA splicing branchpoints relative to a three prime
    splice site. Precisely evaluating LaBranchoR was challenging due to pervasive
    noise in the experimental data, but as we show in our paper, we estimate that
    LaBranchoR correcty predicts a branchpoint for over 90% of 3\''ss. Github link
